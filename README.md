# Data-Mining-Project


Project Introduction

A company wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on the information provided by the customer. To automate this process, we seek to identify customer segments, those who are eligible for the loan amount.

This is a classification problem.

ðŸ“Œ In this Project, I will:

Analyze customer data provided in data set (EDA= exploratory data analysis) 

Build various ML models that can predict loan approval (Logistic Regression / K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) / Naive Bayes (Gaussian NB))
